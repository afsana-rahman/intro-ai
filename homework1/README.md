# Project 1
Three team members contributed to completing this project. I was tasked with writing documentation and completing the conceptual problems. 
The two other team members were tasked with implementing a full-stack solution using A* and Theta* search algorithms to find the shortest path in a grid. Corresponding questions and images in the write-up here are their work. This includes problems 1a, 1c, 1d, and 1f-1h.

The rest of the writeup and problem-solving was completed by me.
